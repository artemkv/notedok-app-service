! DropBox authentication

As a regular user, I want to be recognized as a dropbox user

* When not yet logged in, redirect to DropBox login page
* When redirected back, save the token
* When logged in already, continue with the app
* Pass the random number in the state
* Redirect to https page
* /#access_token=debug allows to bypass the authentication and continue with the debug storage


! Show first 5 notes

As a regular user, I want to see my first 5 notes when I load page initially

* Load list of files from DropBox (async)
* Render first 5 notes (or as many as could find)
	* Only text files should be shown (filter based on file extension ".txt")
	* File name becomes a title (file extension ".txt" is omitted)
	* File content becomes a text
	* Title should be rendred as safe content
	* Text should be rendred as safe content
	* Note loading and rendering should be done asynchronously, since it might take time to retrieve the note content
	* Title is always displayed as a single line
	* Long title should be rendered with "..." at the end, replacing the hidden part
	* Long text should be all visible, the note height is variable and adjusts to fit all text


! Edit a note

As a regular user, I want to edit note title and text

* Title is rendered as a textbox without border, so it is immediately editable
* Title max length is limited to 50 chars
* Text becomes a textarea when clicked (click resulting in a text selection is ignored)
* Title/text textboxes have the same visual style
* When empty, title should be rendered as a watermark "No title"
* When empty, text should be rendered as a watermark "Type your text here"
* After changes are collected to be saved, the text textarea becomes a div again


! Save the changes

As a regular user, I want to make sure the changes I did are saved

* When title/text textbox loses focus, changes are saved to DropBox
* Changes should be saved asynchronously
* If title left empty, generate the file name
* When title is updated (manually or when auto-generated), the file should be renamed
* Title can be invalid file name. The app should make a best effort to replace the invalid characters as follows:
/ becomes (sl)
? becomes (qst)
< becomes (lt)
> becomes (gt)
\ becomes (bsl)
: becomes (col)
* becomes (star)
| becomes (pipe)
" becomes (dqt)
^ becomes (crt)
* If the title is still an invalid file name, dropbox won't sync it to the filesystem. This is known issue.


!  Template note

As a regular user, when I want to add a new note, I want to be able to type right into the empty pre-created template note.

* Render template note as a first note displayed
* Title should be rendered as a watermark "New note"
* Auto-generated file names should be rendered as empty


! Create a note

As a regular user, when I want to add a new note, I want to be able to type right into the empty pre-created note.
Once I start typing, the new empty note should appear allowing me to continue with the next note.

* Editing the template note creates a new template note (content have to change)
* Editing the template note turns it to a regular note, so saving changes should work exactly as with the regular note
* If, after the template note turns it to a regular note, the title is still empty, the title watermark should change to "No title"
* If after editing title/text stays empty, keep template note and don't create a new note


! Delete a note

As a regular user, I want to be able to delete any note

* Clicking on "Delete" button deletes a note
* No questions are asked, no undo provided
* Note gets deleted from DropBox
* Note is removed from the page without re-rendering any other notes
* When done, load and render (async) one more note from the list (if exists), so the number of displayed notes stays the same


! Load next 5 notes

As a regular user, I want to see next 5 notes if the note I am interested in is not yet shown on the page

* When clicked on "More" button load next 5 notes (or as many as could find)
* Loading and rendering should be done the same as for the first 5 notes


! Render links

As a regular user, I want my hyperlinks to be automatically detected, shown as hyperlinks and be clickable.

* When rendering the note text, run it through the regex that detects the hyperlinks and wrap it into <a> tag


! Search

As a regular user, I want to be able to search for my notes (by title).

* Search text box with watermark "Search in titles"
* When user enters the search string and presses "Enter":
** Cleanup all the currently displayed notes
** Load first 5 notes containing search pattern in the title
** When "More" button is clicked, only load notes containing search pattern in the title


! Search auto-suggest

As a regular user, I feel frustrated when I only see first 5 notes and have no idea what is there.
So I want a better hint on what data I can find in my storage

* Auto-suggest search terms in the search textbox based on the titles that are already loaded
* Auto-suggest initialized once after the page is initially loaded, so if you added a note, you need to refresh the page to update auto-suggest
* Auto-suggest takes all existing titles in account, regardless of the current search filter enabled
* Auto-suggest suggests individual terms used on any titles (term is a sequence of letters of any language)
* Auto-suggest also suggests complete titles, but in this case all search terms already entered in the search textbox should be present in the title
* Complete titles are shown after individual terms


! Number of notes yet to load

As a regular user, I feel frustrated when I only see first 5 notes and have no idea how many there are more.

* Indicate number of notes matching the current search filter and not yet loaded on the "More" button: "More (N not loaded)"


! Tags

As a regular user, I want to organize notes into "taxonomies". Simply put, I want to be able to tag a note.

* Tag is a any sequence of characters which starts with "#" and is separated from the rest of the text by spaces
* Auto-suggest in search textbox treats tags exactly as individual terms
* Typing "#" in the title of the note triggers auto-suggest that shows top 10 of previously entered tags matching the input
* After the title is updated, all new tags from it become immediately available for the auto-suggest next time you edit the title


! Wiki basic markup

As a regular user, I want to be able to use basic formatting options to control how the text is rendered on the webpage.

* *bold* is rendered as <b>bold</b>
* _italics_ is rendered as <i>italics</i>
* --deleted-- is rendered as <del>deleted</del>
* ++underline++ is rendered as <u>underline</u>
* ^superscript^ is rendered as <sup>superscript</sup>
* ~subscript~ is rendered as <sub>subscript</sub>
* Text inside {" and "} is not formatted and rendered "as is"
* Text inside [ and ] becomes a hyperlink
* Text inside {code} and {code} is formatted as a code


! Wiki ul markup

As a regular user, I want to be able to create unordered lists.

* Line that starts with "- " or "* " creates a <li> within <ul> (<ul> is created if needed)
* This story is about 1 level deep lists


! Share a note

As a regular user, I want to send a link to my friend with the note I created. 
My friend should be able to see it correctly rendered.
My friend should be able to see it even if doesn't have DropBox.

* Generate a permanent link
* When that link is opened, one single note should be rendered
* No edit/create/delete functionality should be available in the preview


! Undo delete

As a regular user, I am worried that I can delete a note my mistake, accidentally clicking on "Delete"

* Need to generate an "undo note", the note placeholder with the "Restore" button
* "Restore" button, when clicked, should restore the note
* The "undo note" should be generated at the position where the note used to be
* The restored note should respond to events correctly (editing + save + re-delete)
* After the page is refreshed, or another note is deleted, the "undo note" should disappear


! Intro

As a site owner, I want to give introduction for the user who comes to the site the first time. 
After the user has connected to Dropbox, she should not see the intro anymore.

* Render the intro if there is no flag in the local storage
* Once user is authenticated, set the flag in the local storage that prevents intro next time


! Progress indicator

As a regular user, I want to have an understanding that the page is alive and doing something

* Render the progress indicator while file list is being retrieved


! Wiki headings markup

As a regular user, I want to be able to create headers.

* "! " in the beginning of the new line creates h1
* "!! " in the beginning of the new line creates h2
* "!!! " in the beginning of the new line creates h3
* "!!!! " in the beginning of the new line creates h4
* "!!!!! " in the beginning of the new line creates h5
* "!!!!!! " in the beginning of the new line creates h6
* Alternatively, you can use "h1. ", "h2. ", "h3. ", "h4. ", "h5. ", "h6. "


! Adaptive height

As a regular user, when I edit a note, if the text is long, I want to have a bigger text area for editing without the need to resize it.

* If note text is longer than 10 lines, render the textarea 600px high
* Otherwise, keep the same height: 300px
* Count actual number of lines: count 1 line for every line end char
* Additionaly, count 1 additional line for every sequence of 80 chars inside the same line


! Explicit finish note editing

As a first time user I don't understand where should I click to save note text.
As a regular user, if I made wrong editing, I want to be able to cancel editing without saving the changes.

* When switching to editing mode, replace the "Share Edit Delete" control buttons with "Save Cancel" buttons
* Consider either physically replacing the content of the control panel or just changing the visibility
* Clicking on "Save" saves the note text normally
* Clicking on "Cancel" discards the changes
* In any case, after the editing is finished, replace the "Save Cancel" control buttons with buttons "Share Edit Delete"


! Explicit finish note editing - template note

As a first time user I don't understand where should I click to save note text.
As a regular user, I expect template note behave the same as a regular note when in editing

* When switching to editing mode, show "Save Cancel" buttons
* After the editing is finished, hide all buttons


All above is done ======================================================================================================================================


! Up to date
* --Update packages--
* Finish UT: all modules
* --Rejected:Use Require.js module system?--
* --Get rid of the code duplication--
* --Why not caching in browser?--


! Save draft

As a regular user, I want the application to save my changes periodically as I type

* Periodically save the document that is being edited
? The same file or the draft file?
? Do we need cancel button?


! Offline work

As a regular user, I want to make sure that the changes I did are eventually saved.

* If the connection to DropBox is lost, queue the save operation
* When the connection is restored, carry out the queued saves
* Do not save the same file twice
* Make sure to save the latest edit


! Make search criteria linkable

As a regular user, after I filtered the notes using the search string, I want to be able to save the URL. 
Later, when I paste the saved URL into the address textbox of the browser, I want to be able the filter be applied from the start.

* --Store the hashtags from URL in the state that is passed to the authenitcation endpoint together with the random number--
* --When getting it back, decode the state into number and hashtags--
* --Apply the hashtags to the current location--
* --When the hashtag is updated directly in the URL, the search textbox should reflect the changes--
* Use history API


! Wiki more advanced markup


! Insert images


! Error handling

As a regular user, I don't want to wait until the note is saved to DropBox, when I am done editing it, neither I want to see the confirmation dialog.
I don't want my flow interrupted in any way.
However, if the connection is lost and note could not be saved, I want to be informed, in the non-blocking way. 

* Show an error panel, if there are errors
* Add an error to the error panel, if it is already displayed
* Allow to close an error panel, this loses all previously added errors


! Allow to login as a different user (logout)

! Insert shared note in your deck

! Localization

! First tag in the title determines a subfolder to store the note

! Sequence of tags in the title determines a sequnce of subfolders the note should be stored under

! Consider checking mime type filter files to show
This would allow showing files with extensions other than ".txt"

! Sort auto-suggest items:
* A-Z
* Frequency

! The notes are sorted by date, the latest added first (no support on API level)

! Add note from the open page

! Android app

! Edit note full-screen, notepad-like
